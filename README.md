Hello All,

Welcome to my page! I am a social service professional transitioning into the tech world. I am currently enrolled at Promineo Tech's front end software developer program and utilizing the skills I learn on a weekly basis to create websites and apps that I believe can make an impact in the world. My career goal is to use technology to bridge the gap between innovation and social services and ensuring that nobody is left behind.

Outside of coding, you can find me in boxing and Muay Thai gyms, at a fitness gym, and biking around Massachusetts.
